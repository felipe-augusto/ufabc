Java is a programming language originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which
has since merged into Oracle Corporation) and released as a core component of Sun Microsystems
Java platform. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode (class file) that can run on
any Java Virtual Machine regardless of computer architecture. Java is a general-purpose,
concurrent, class-based, object-oriented language that is specifically designed to have as few
implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once,
run anywhere", meaning that code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run
on another. Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for
client-server web applications, with a reported 10 million users.

The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were
developed by Sun. In compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun relicensed
most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Others have also developed
alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java and GNU Classpath.
